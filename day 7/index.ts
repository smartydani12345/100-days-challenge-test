//Question 19: Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!

let guest: string[] = ["Kareem", "Sumair", "Dawood", "Hameed","Sohail","Anus","Hamza","jameel","irshad","kashif","akram"];
console.log(`I am inviting ${guest.length} people to dinner.`);



//Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

//Explain & TIP: Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like and list several examples.

let placesToVisit: string[] = [
    "Kyoto, Japan",
    "Machu Picchu, Peru",
    "Santorini, Greece",
    "Rome, Italy",
    "Banff National Park, Canada"
];

// Display the places to visit
console.log("Places I'd like to visit:");
for (let i = 0; i < placesToVisit.length; i++) {
    console.log(`${i + 1}. ${placesToVisit[i]}`);
}


//Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
