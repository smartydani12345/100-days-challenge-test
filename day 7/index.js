//Question 19: Dinner Guests: Use one of your programs from Exercises 14 through 18 to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

var guest = ["Kareem", "Sumair", "Dawood", "Hameed", "Sohail", "Anus", "Hamza", "jameel", "irshad", "kashif", "akram"];
console.log("I am inviting ".concat(guest.length, " people to dinner."));

    "Rome, Italy",
    "Banff National Park, Canada"
];
// Display the places to visit
console.log("Places I'd like to visit:");
for (var i = 0; i < placesToVisit.length; i++) {
    console.log("".concat(i + 1, ". ").concat(placesToVisit[i]));
}
//Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
