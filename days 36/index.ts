//Question 106: Determine if a given year is a leap year using comparison operators.

//Explain & TIP: A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400. This rule helps align our calendar years with the Earth's orbital period.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!




// This function checks if a year is a leap year
function isLeapYear(year: number): boolean {
    // Checks the conditions for a leap year
    return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0;
  }
  
  console.log(isLeapYear(2020)); // Outputs: true
  console.log(isLeapYear(1900)); // Outputs: false
  // By using comparison operators, we can easily determine if a year is a leap year or not.

  //Question 107: Write a condition using logical operators that checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3.

//Explain & TIP: Checking for divisibility involves using the modulo operator (%) to see if there's any remainder. A number divisible by both 2 and 3 without a remainder is also divisible by 6.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!

// This function checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3
function isDivisibleByTwoAndThree(number: number): boolean {
    // Uses the modulo operator to check for no remainder
    return number % 2 === 0 && number % 3 === 0;
  }
  
  console.log(isDivisibleByTwoAndThree(12)); // Outputs: true
  console.log(isDivisibleByTwoAndThree(14)); // Outputs: false
  // Logical operators help us verify the number's divisibility by both 2 and 3.


//Question 108: Compare two strings to check if they are identical, ignoring case sensitivity.

//Explain & TIP: To compare strings without considering their case (uppercase/lowercase), you can convert both strings to the same case before comparing.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!

// This function compares two strings, ignoring case sensitivity
function areStringsEqualIgnoreCase(str1: string, str2: string): boolean {
    // Converts both strings to lowercase before comparison
    return str1.toLowerCase() === str2.toLowerCase();
  }
  
  console.log(areStringsEqualIgnoreCase("hello", "Hello")); // Outputs: true
  console.log(areStringsEqualIgnoreCase("world", "Word")); // Outputs: false
  // We make both strings lowercase to ensure the comparison ignores case differences.
