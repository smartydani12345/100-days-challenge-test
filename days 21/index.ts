//Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

//Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!

// Making a list (enum) for different types of vehicles
enum VehicleType {
    Car,
    Truck,
    Motorcycle
}

// Showing one type of vehicle from the list
console.log(VehicleType.Car); // It shows 0 because enums start counting from 0
// Here, we're just checking what number the Car category got in our list.


//Question 62: Making a Student Template: Create a blueprint for student information, including their name, age, and the classes they're taking, and then fill in this blueprint with an example student.

//Explain & TIP: This blueprint, called an interface, helps ensure all students have the same kind of information, making your code more organized.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!

// Creating a blueprint (interface) for student information
interface Student {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    courses: string[];
}

// Filling in the blueprint with an example student
let student: Student = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 22,
    courses: ["Math", "Science", "History"]
};

// Showing the student's information
console.log(student);
// We're using the blueprint to make sure our student has a name, age, and list of courses.


//Question 63: Shape Shifter: Write a program that can describe either a circle or a rectangle using a special type alias, including properties unique to each shape.

//Explain & TIP: A type alias lets you create a custom type. It's like a shortcut for describing more complex information, such as the details of different shapes.

//Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!

// Creating a custom type (type alias) for shapes that could be circles or rectangles
type Shape = {
    kind: "circle" | "rectangle";
    radius?: number; // Only for circles
    width?: number; // Only for rectangles
    height?: number; // Only for rectangles
};

// Describing a circle using our Shape type
let circle: Shape = {
    kind: "circle",
    radius: 5
};

// Describing a rectangle using our Shape type
let rectangle: Shape = {
    kind: "rectangle",
    width: 10,
    height: 20
};

// Showing what we described
console.log(circle); // Here's the circle
console.log(rectangle); // And here's the rectangle
// We made a flexible program that can describe different shapes in detail.
